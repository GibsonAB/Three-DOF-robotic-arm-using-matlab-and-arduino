# Three-DOF-robotic-arm-using-matlab-and-arduino
Using matlab I have created a code implementing topics like inverse and forward kinemetics to create a three DOF robotic arm. I have used Arduino to communicate with matlab for joint angles and the arduino will send the required data for actuator for the actuation.
