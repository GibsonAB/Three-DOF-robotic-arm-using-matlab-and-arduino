# Three-DOF-robotic-arm-using-matlab-and-arduino
Using matlab I have created a code implementing topics like inverse and forward kinemetics to create a three DOF robotic arm. I have used Arduino to communicate with matlab for joint angles and the arduino will send the required data to actuator for the actuation.
Arduino components required are Arduino Uno board, 3 stepper motors, jumper wires and bread board. Make sure the connections matches the pin numbers in arduino code.
Upload the arduino code after connecting to correct serial port.
Now run the matlab code.
